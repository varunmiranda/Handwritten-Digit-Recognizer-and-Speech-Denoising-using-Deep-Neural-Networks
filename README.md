# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer-and-Speech-Denoising-using-Deep-Neural-Networks

Problem 1:

MNIST Classification: The task is to correctly classify handwritten images using Deep Neural Networks and also reduce the dimensionality of the pixels by displaying it in a two dimensional graph using tSNE (t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Problem 2:

Speech Denoising: We are given a train dirty and train clean speech sample to train the Deep Neural Network model and we are given two test audio files (wav) to remove the noise.
